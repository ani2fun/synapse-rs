// The `CodeExecutor` FSM (oracle: client/src/execution/logic/executor.rs, itself a port of
// `shared/execution/CodeExecutor.scala`) — pure `State → State` transitions for one runnable
// block. The staleness trick: there is no real HTTP cancel, so `cancel`/`started` bump the
// opaque `RunHandle` and a late result whose handle no longer matches is a NO-OP (`completed`/
// `failed` return the state unchanged).
//
// Functions take the state as their first argument rather than living as methods on a class —
// matching this codebase's other pure-logic ports (`catalog/progress.ts`, `catalog/prefs.ts`),
// where state is plain data and behaviour is free functions over it.

// boundary without a WeakMap/closure trick that would be overkill for an ID that only ever needs
// `===` comparison, so this is a deliberate, lighter divergence — same intent, weaker guarantee.
