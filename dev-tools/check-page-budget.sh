# ── PER-PAGE EAGER-JS BUDGET ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Astro ships each page only its own eager assets — no single bundle serves every page — so the
# honest measure is PER PAGE — fetch the page, collect what its HTML makes the browser download
# before the reader sees content (module scripts + stylesheets), gzip-sum them. Lazy islands
# (Monaco, keycloak-js, mermaid, the viz wasm) are dynamic imports and never appear in the HTML —
# they stay out of the sum BY CONSTRUCTION, not by glob.
#
# Four page kinds, one budget each: the landing, a prose lesson, a problem page, the blog list.
# Measured against fixture content: landing 44 · lesson 52 · problem 52 · blog 14 KiB gz.
# These drift with ordinary feature work (the reader redesign, the long-form stylesheet and the
# authoring context each moved them a KiB or two) — re-measure when you touch this line rather
# than assuming a rise is a regression. The signal is the 250 KiB cap, not the last recorded digit.
# Budget 250 KiB: generous headroom over the heaviest page (~5×). If a page ever approaches this
# budget, something structural regressed (an island went eager); tighten, don't raise.
#
# The viz wasm cap rides along when the pkg is a RELEASE build (VIZ_WASM_RELEASE=1 — CI's e2e
# builds release; a local dev-profile pkg would fail the cap for being unoptimized, which is
# noise, not signal).
#
# Usage: check-page-budget.sh [base-url]   (default http://localhost:8280; stack must be UP)
#        PAGE_BUDGET_KIB=250 VIZ_WASM_BUDGET_KIB=350 to override.
