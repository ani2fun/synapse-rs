//! The four ports the authoring use cases drive, and the error every one of them speaks.
//!
//! Each is use-case shaped rather than technology shaped: `ContentForge` says "commit this file,
//! open a pull request", not "PUT /contents, POST /pulls". That is what lets a dry-run adapter be
//! a first-class citizen instead of a mock, and what would let a GitHub App (or a different forge
//! entirely) slot in without the service noticing.
