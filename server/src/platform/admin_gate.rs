//! The admin gate, extracted in step 49 from `submission/http/admin.rs` where it landed in
//! step 21. Two contexts need it now — the allowlist panel and the readership read — and the
//! invariant is worth stating in one place rather than twice:
//!
//! **ADMIN is CONFIG (`ADMIN_USERS`), never a token claim, and the server re-checks it on
//! EVERY call.** `MeDto.admin` exists so the client can hide a menu item; it is not what
//! authorises anything.
