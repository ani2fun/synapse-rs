//! Readership (step 49) — a thin flat context (CLAUDE.md: "thin contexts flat"), deliberately
//! NOT folded into `catalog`.
//!
//! Catalog is a pure content-serving context whose single output port is a filesystem; giving
//! it a Postgres port would make it dual-store for a concern that is not content. And it is not
//! `submission` either, which is about the reader's code rather than their reading. Measurement
//! is its own capability, so it gets its own context — the same reasoning that made `blog` a
//! deliberate twin of `catalog` in step 18 rather than a reuse of it.
//!
//! There is no `domain/` here on purpose: a view is a timestamp and a path. Nothing in this
//! context has behaviour worth modelling, so a domain layer would be ceremony.
