# ── Port reclamation, shared by `dev` and `e2e` (step 53) ─────────────────────
# Sourced, not executed. Both scripts bind FIXED ports by design — Vite is
# --strictPort because the Keycloak dev realm whitelists specific origins, and a
# silent bump 403s the silent-SSO iframe (the step-39 trap). So a port being held
# always means a leftover process, never a neighbour to negotiate with.
#
# Before this existed, a stale server on :8280 made the new bind die with
# "Address already in use (os error 48)" while Vite carried on and proxied to the
# OLD binary — a page that looks alive and serves pre-edit code.
