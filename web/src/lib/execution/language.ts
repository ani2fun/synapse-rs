// table, mirroring `server/execution/domain/Language::aliases`. The server stays the authority;
// an alias added there joins this table in the same step.
//
// Two jobs, and the second is why the table exists at all: telling a runnable fence from a
// plaintext one, and folding every spelling of a language onto ONE canonical token so a stored
// preference of `python` still matches a block whose fence says `py` or `python3`.

// value is the same string the server's `Language::resolve` would land on.

// The Rust oracle keeps this table module-private (only its own test module reaches it); TS has
// no file-private visibility that would let a separate `*.test.ts` see an unexported const, so
// it is exported here rather than duplicated — a deliberate, minor divergence, not a design
// change (a future language switcher would want this exact list too).
