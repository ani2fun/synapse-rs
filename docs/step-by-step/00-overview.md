# synapse-rs — the build book

A deliberate, from-scratch **Rust rebuild of Synapse** (which was itself a rebuild of Cortex),
made slice by slice with **Synapse as the reference oracle** at `~/Development/homelab/synapse`:
its chapters are the design narrative, its test suites are the spec, its live deployment
(synapse.kakde.eu) is the parity target. Re-derive cleanly; never copy a decision you don't
understand. Scope, stack, and discipline: [RS001](../adr/rs001-the-rust-rebuild.md).

One chapter per step; one squashed commit per step, tagged `step-NN`. Every tag compiles and its
tests pass. Chapters present the **final design** of their step — bug fixes live in the step that
introduced the feature, never as later afterthoughts.

## The step map

| RS-P2 catalog | 03–06 | The reference hexagon walk: domain → `ContentRepository` → filesystem adapter → http (03–06) · the Leptos reader + markdown pipeline (07–08) |
| RS-P3 execution | 07–09 | CodeExecutor FSM (09) · go-judge adapter + `/api/run` (10) · Monaco + RunnableCodeBlock + auth-gated editing + keymap (11 + post-33 fixes) |
| RS-P4 reader | 10 | Browse, palette, full-width problem pages, collapsible categories, reading preferences (12–13 + post-33) |
| RS-P5 submissions | 11–12 | Aggregate + async judging + sqlx (14–15) · 202/poll + workbench + live-refetch + chrome (16, 23 + post-33) |

| RS-P7 viz | 19–22 | The viz engine vs the cortex-goldens (24–27) · widget spine + Visualise + tracers (28–31) · the bespoke widget gallery (33) |
| RS-P8 UX + docs | 23–26 | "Your Turn" practice widget · landing tour + hero · mobile navigation + LikeC4 chrome (38) · architecture docs + capstone (32) |

> **Step 40's shape.** Every step through 39 is one squashed commit. Step 40 is eleven
> (`c9b302f..HEAD`): its work was interactive — a design question, two answers built and kept,
> a performance diagnosis, and the fixes that followed — and each commit was pushed to public
> `main` as it landed. Squashing after the fact would rewrite published history, so the tag
> simply marks the tip. The invariant that matters is untouched: `step-40` compiles and its
> tests pass.
