//! The dry-run `ContentForge` — what a deployment with no GitHub token gets.
//!
//! It is not a mock and not a stub: it is a real, shipped mode. Dev, CI and the e2e stack all run
//! the whole editing flow against it — the allowlist gate, the drift guard, the validation, the
//! branch derivation, the reuse rule and the stored history are all exercised for real, and only
//! the network call at the very end is skipped.
//!
//! The one thing it must never do is let a contributor believe their change was proposed. It opens
//! no pull request and reports `None`, which is what makes `mode` show up in the API answer and
//! the editor say plainly that nothing was submitted.
