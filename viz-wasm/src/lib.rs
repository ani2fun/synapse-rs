//! The standalone viz crate: the widget spine (a host that consumes `VizCases`, dispatches
//! through the pure `RenderFamily` decision, and drives every animation with the one
//! `Playback` stepper), the trace session, and the Visualise modal. Layout is computed ONCE
//! over the union of steps; the step signal only toggles drawing.
//!
//! The Astro app loads the cdylib as a lazy wasm bundle through [`entry`]'s wasm-bindgen
//! surface; the crate also builds as an rlib so the engine tests + goldens run natively under
//! `cargo test`. Mounting, the editor/tracer externs, the `/api/run` fetch + bearer seam, the
//! theme probe, and the logger all live in-crate, so the crate is self-contained by
//! construction — the host supplies nothing beyond calling into it.

/// The pure viz ENGINE — contract, vocabulary, geometry, adapt pipeline and goldens.
/// Lives in this crate, not `synapse-shared`, because the server never references it and it
/// needs no home in the wire-contract kernel. `shapes`/`decoder` live inside it too — they are
/// pure engine logic, and keeping them here is what lets the purity gate cover them.
