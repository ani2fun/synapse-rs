/**
 * End-to-end smoke (step 52).
 *
 * These run against the PRODUCTION-SHAPED serve — the real axum server with `STATIC_ROOT`
 * pointing at a built `client/dist` — not against Vite. Two reasons, and the second is a scar:
 *
 *  1. It is the only way to exercise what the server actually does with a request: step 50's
 *     per-page `<title>` and meta injection, the cache headers, `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt`.
 *     Vite serves `index.html` straight off disk and none of that exists in dev.
 *  2. Step 19's standing lesson, pinned in its chapter: dev NEVER reproduces CSP breakage,
 *     because Vite serves without the origin's security headers. A suite that only ever ran
 *     against Vite would be blind to the entire class of bug that has bitten this project
 *     hardest in production.
 *
 * The server is assumed to be already running (CI starts it as an explicit step, so its
 * readiness and its logs are visible rather than buried in a Playwright subprocess). Locally,
 * `dev-tools/e2e` builds the dist and starts it for you.
