//! Reading progress (step 51) — pure, so `cargo test` covers it natively.
//!
//! Two facts are kept, and they are deliberately in SEPARATE localStorage keys rather than one
//! packed record: the set of lessons finished, and the last lesson opened. `prefs.rs` packs four
//! fields into one `|`-joined string parsed by an exact-arity slice pattern
//! (`let [s, l, f, w] = … else { return DEFAULT_PREFS }`), which means adding a fifth field
//! silently resets every existing reader's saved settings. That trap is worth not rebuilding:
//! one key, one job, and a key that fails to parse costs only itself.
//!
//! The done-set is newline-separated because it is a LIST, not a fixed record — there is no
//! arity to get wrong, and an unrecognised or blank line is skipped rather than poisoning the
//! rest. Lesson paths are `/`-joined slugs, so they can contain neither a newline nor a `|`.
