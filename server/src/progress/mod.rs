//! Per-user completion progress — a thin flat context (CLAUDE.md: "thin contexts flat"). There is
//! no `domain/` here on purpose: a completion is a user id, a lesson path, and a timestamp; nothing
//! has behaviour worth modelling, so a domain layer would be ceremony.
//!
//! It is deliberately NOT `submission` (which is about the reader's CODE) nor `insights` (which is
//! anonymous content POPULARITY, with no user id by design). This is the account's own ✓ ticks,
//! keyed by the Keycloak `sub` — the same value `submissions.user_id` stores — and it owns its own
//! Postgres port so neither of those contexts becomes dual-store for a concern that is not theirs.
