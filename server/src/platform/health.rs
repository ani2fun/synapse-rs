//! The `platform` context's health use cases (oracle: `Health.scala`), split the way
//! orchestrators actually consume them: a shallow **liveness** answer and a dependency-checking
//! **readiness** answer. Conflating the two is the classic operational footgun — see `status`.
//!
//! Liveness stays a free function (nothing to invert). Readiness declares the port the module
//! header always anticipated: it needs a real backing-store ping, so the seam finally exists.
