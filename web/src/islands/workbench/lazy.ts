/**
 * Viewport-lazy Monaco (port of client/src/execution/view/lazy.rs, step-40 semantics).
 *
 * Two halves, same as the Rust:
 *  - `watchNear`: an IntersectionObserver with a 600px vertical margin flips a callback when
 *    the block approaches the viewport. No-IO environments degrade to eagerly near.
 *  - the live-editor registry: at most MAX_LIVE_EDITORS Monaco instances exist at once; when a
 *    new one registers over the cap, the oldest FAR instance is evicted (its owner drops the
 *    editor and re-arms the lazy mount). Visible editors are never evicted — safe because all
 *    block state lives in the store, not Monaco, so a re-approach re-mounts losslessly.
