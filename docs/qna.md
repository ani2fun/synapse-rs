# Design Q&A

Questions the user asks along the way, with the design reasoning — the synapse
convention, carried over.

## Q1 — Many Monaco editors on one page: what's the elegant shape? (2026-07-17)

**Question.** How are multiple runnable Monaco editors handled on a single lesson page?
Could one instance serve everything — e.g. plain ` ```python ` fences (no `run` attr) get an
"Open editor to try" button that opens a fullscreen popup codebench (Monaco + stdin + run +
console output, Esc to close, edit gated on sign-in) — so a page never over-loads with
editor instances and authors never need the `run` attribute just to make code tryable?

**What exists today (the facts the options rest on).**

- The Monaco *library* is already a lazy island chunk — it downloads and parses **once per
  page session** no matter how many editors mount. The per-block cost is the *instance*
  (`monaco.editor.create`): DOM, view zones, per-editor listeners — roughly 10–15 MB heap
  each. That is the thing worth bounding.
- Plain fences render through **shiki at parse time** — static HTML, zero runtime cost,
  no layout shift. They are the right reading surface and stay.
- A multi-variant `run` block already shares **one** Monaco across its language tabs
  (buffer + tokenizer swap in place — step 30); the practice widget lazy-mounts its
  editorial panes; the Visualise modal's editor mounts per open and disposes on close.
  So the swap-one-instance seam is proven.
- Current content has 1–3 `run` blocks per lesson — instance count is not yet a problem;
  the design is about not letting it *become* one, and about making every code block
  tryable.

**The options.**

- **A — the popup codebench (the user's proposal, refined).** One app-level
  `CodebenchStore` + one `<CodebenchModal>` mounted once in the shell (the proven
  `VisualiseModal` singleton pattern). Every shiki block hydrates a hover **"⤢ Open
  editor to try"** pill (the diagram-Enlarge `modal-btn` chrome); clicking opens the
  near-fullscreen modal with ONE Monaco created on first open and *reused forever after*
  (`setValue` + `setModelLanguage` — the step-30 seam), the fence's language pre-picked,
  Run + editable stdin + the runnable output panel (reusing `BlockStore.launch` and the
  existing panels), Esc to close like every other popup. Editing gates on auth exactly
  like inline blocks (the `wb__edit-bar` sign-in banner + the login redirect); Run stays
  anonymous-friendly. **Zero markdown changes** — authors write bare fences.
- **B — viewport-lazy `run` blocks.** Keep the authored inline-workbench UX, but a `run`
  fence renders its shiki + toolbar first and only creates Monaco when it scrolls near
  the viewport (IntersectionObserver, generous rootMargin; Run/Edit click force-mounts).
  Optionally an LRU that disposes editors far off-screen back to shiki — block state
  already lives in `BlockStore`, so nothing is lost. Bounds live instances to what's on
  screen (typically 1–2).
- **C — a true editor pool.** 2–3 `create`d editors total; every block owns only a cheap
  `ITextModel`; focus/scroll attaches a pooled editor to the active block
  (`editor.setModel` + DOM re-parenting). The most "IDE-like" and the most complex:
  re-parenting, focus restoration, per-block decorations and keybinding context all get
  subtle. Not warranted at 1–3 blocks per page.
- **D — click-to-mount.** Shiki until first interaction, then swap Monaco in for that
  block. Strictly dominated by B (same effect, worse first-interaction latency, no
  auto-readiness for the block you're looking at).

**Recommendation: A now, B when content density demands it, skip C/D.**

A is the high-value move: it adds a *capability* (every code block on the platform becomes
runnable) while structurally capping plain-fence cost at one shared instance, reuses five
proven pieces (modal singleton, language-swap seam, BlockStore, output panels, modal-btn
chrome), and needs no content migration. B is a contained follow-up that only pays off
once lessons carry many `run` blocks — measure first, since today's pages hold 1–3. The
Esc rule is already app-wide (viz modal, diagram zoom, practice enlarge, drawer); the
codebench simply joins it.

**Outcome (same day).** The user chose **B** first — built as `execution/view/lazy.rs` +
the `RunnableBlock` lazy wiring (commit `2197117`): shiki placeholder (the island's new
`highlightCode`) until near-viewport (600px margin) or first interaction; a page-level
registry caps live instances at 3, evicting the oldest FAR editor losslessly (state in
`BlockStore`; re-mounts restore the ACTIVE variant + unlock). If `IntersectionObserver`
is unavailable the block mounts eagerly.

Then the user changed their mind and asked for **A too** — built as
`execution/view/codebench.rs`: one `CodebenchModal` mounted once in the shell holds ONE
Monaco reused across every open (the frame stays in the DOM `display:none` between opens
so the instance survives; each open swaps value + tokenizer). Every plain shiki fence in a
runnable-language (the `Language::aliases` list mirrored client-side) grows a hover "⤢ Open
editor to try" pill; the modal runs `BlockStore.launch` with an editable stdin box and the
shared `Output` panel, Esc closes, editing gates on sign-in (read-only + the `wb__edit-bar`
banner) while Run stays anonymous. A and B now coexist: authored `run` fences get the
inline lazy workbench, plain fences get the on-demand popup.

## Q2 — A diagram-heavy lesson renders very slowly. Why, and how to fix it? (2026-07-17)

**Question.** The multithreading-concurrency basics lesson renders very slowly — the whole
page stays blank, then everything appears at once. How to improve rendering performance?

**Diagnosis (traced through the render path).** The page has 5 d2 diagrams (2 standalone + a
3-slide slideshow) that rendered **at parse time, sequentially**: `render.ts`'s `d2Transform`
did `await renderD2(...)` in a `for` loop, INSIDE the single `renderLesson` promise. The
client's `set_inner_html` only fired after that promise resolved — so **all prose stayed
invisible until the last d2 diagram's WASM (dagre) layout finished**, and the first diagram
also paid the one-time multi-MB d2 WASM download. It re-ran on every navigation (no cache).
Secondary: mermaid re-ran `mermaid.initialize` per diagram; nothing memoized rendered HTML.

**Fix — prose-first (chosen scope: full).** Three changes:

1. **d2 off the parse-time path.** `d2Transform` is now a SYNCHRONOUS grouping pass that emits
   source-carrying placeholders (`.d2-block[data-source]` / `.d2-slideshow[data-slides]`), no
   WASM. d2 renders on the CLIENT at mount via a new `@diagram` island (`renderD2Source`,
   reusing one `D2()` instance), gated by an IntersectionObserver (`lazy::watch_near`, reused
   from option B) so a diagram renders only when it nears the viewport — each in its own
   `spawn_local` (concurrent). The pipeline now returns as soon as markdown + shiki finish, so
   **prose paints immediately** and the multi-MB d2 WASM loads lazily. Malformed diagrams
   surface an error card at mount (like mermaid), not at parse time.
2. **mermaid.initialize once** — a module-level latch; the config re-parse no longer repeats
   per diagram.
3. **Rendered-HTML cache** — memoized by a hash of the raw markdown at the `markdown::render`
   bridge, so back/forward + sidebar re-clicks skip the whole pipeline. Small strings now (d2
   is client-rendered, not baked in).

Verified live: prose (14 headings) + mermaid render immediately while d2 stays lazy; the d2
island produces a valid SVG from raw source; re-navigation renders identically. The
scroll→render trigger couldn't be driven in the headless browser pane (its IntersectionObserver
is frozen — the same limitation as option B), but the render path + the proven `watch_near`
wiring cover it in a real browser. 363 rust + 45 vitest; bundle 629/700.

**Fix follow-up (same day).** The first cut showed white boxes — two bugs the headless
verification missed: (1) the viewport-lazy IntersectionObserver gate left diagrams unrendered
(the observer's `near` never reliably flipped true for the reader), and (2) the module-level
reused `D2()` instance DEADLOCKS on concurrent compiles (3 diagrams rendering at once hung it
— verified). Both fixed: d2 now renders EAGERLY at mount like mermaid (each diagram in its own
task, concurrent), with a FRESH `new D2()` per render (only the multi-MB WASM import is cached).
Prose-first is preserved — it comes from d2 being off the PARSE path, not from the laziness.
Verified: all 3 d2 diagrams render with real viewBoxes (879×391, 192×208, 459×869), no hangs.
