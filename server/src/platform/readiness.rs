//! The Postgres `ReadinessProbe` adapter.
//!
//! `platform` is a thin context and stays flat (ADR-S007: layer in proportion to complexity),
//! so this adapter sits beside its port rather than under an `infrastructure/` of its own —
//! the same call the context already makes for the rate limiter and the proxy.
//!
//! Postgres is the ONLY hard dependency: the server fail-fasts without it at boot and cannot
//! serve submissions without it. go-judge, Keycloak and Ollama all degrade to honest error
//! responses, so they must NOT gate readiness — a judge outage should not pull the whole site
//! out of the load balancer.
