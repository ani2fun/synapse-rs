// The authored test suite + pure judging — mirrors `judge` + `stdin_for` in
// shared/src/execution/test_run.rs, used by BOTH the server and the workbench island.
// This hand-written `ArgSpec`/`TestCase`/`TestSpec` is the workbench's JUDGING vocabulary and its
// TS home, same as `test_run.rs` is their Rust one. A SAMPLE projection of `TestSpec` also crosses
// the wire on `LessonPayloadDto.tests` (the generated `components["schemas"]["TestSpec"]` in
// `../api/schema.gen`); `islands/problem` parses that payload back into this structurally identical
// shape, so the two stay in lock-step by design.
//
// Kept in lock-step with the Rust twin by `shared/test-vectors/judge-vectors.json`: both
// `judge.test.ts` (here) and `shared/src/execution/judge_vectors_test.rs` run the SAME vectors,
// so a change to either side's rules fails a test on both.
