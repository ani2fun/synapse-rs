//! Request tracing (step 45, closing RS001's `route→service→adapter` claim).
//!
//! Before this the server emitted 48 flat events with no span context: a 500 in production
//! could not be tied back to the request that caused it, because nothing carried a request
//! identity across the route → service → adapter hops. `tracing` was a dependency and a
//! logging macro, not an observability story.
//!
//! The route hop lives here. The service and adapter hops are `#[instrument]` attributes at
//! their own layers, which nest inside this span automatically — that is the entire reason
//! spans beat structured events: the child does not have to know the parent's fields.
